    Hi, my name is Vismary and I am double majoring in Accounting and Information Management and Technology. I am interested in software that assists with reading and creating financial statements. My accomplishments: Landing on the Deanâ€™s List for the Spring semester for both Whitman and the iSchool and landing an internship during my first year of college. Outside of my academics, I enjoy watching sports and doing a lot of arts and crafts activities like pottery.
