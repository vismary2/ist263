                <h3>Featured Destination of the Month: New York City</h3>

                <p>
                    New York City is a place where every street feels alive with energy and possibility. 
                    Start your day at the historic Radio City Music Hall, it is a landmark that continues 
                    to dazzle visitors with its concerts, shows, and the world-famous Rockettes. Just a short 
                    distnace away, the piers along the Hudson River, like Pier 68, offer peaceful views of the 
                    skyline and a glimpse of the city's waterfront charm. It it perfect for catching the sunset 
                    or enjoying a quiet walk. And for a taste of city life, step into a bustling NYC train station, 
                    where locals and travelers move in perfect rhythm beneath the hum of the tracks. 
                    From its entertaiment icons to its hidden corners, New York City blends culture, motion, 
                    and magic like nowhere else.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Vismary. I am a sophomore at Syracuse University studying Accounting and IT. I gained an interest in traveling 
                    over the past couple of years. I began traveling for vacations 2 years ago and found my love for it. I've only done a few trips 
                    but I hope that will change in the future! I am also from New York City so I spend a lot of my time trying to find the hidden gems 
                    in NY and do lots of fun activities.
                </p>
