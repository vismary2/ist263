                The first destination is Puerto Rico! I went for the first time about a year ago now and spent 
                2 weeks there celebrating Christmas and to bring in the new year. It was an amazing experience and 
                it was still very warm having went in December. From Old San Juan's colorful streets 
                to the rainforest trails of El Yunque, Puerto Rico is filled with history, nature, and vibrant culture. 
                I personally went ATV riding through the forest and was able to see the tallest part of the mountain. I 
                also visited the old fort used to protect the island back in the day where they had amazing historic sites 
                and places to eat. Overall, it was an amazing experience!

        <div class="destination2">
            <h3>Dominican Republic</h3>

            <img src="../project_images/pool_dr 1.jpg" alt="Image of a pool in DR">
            <p>
                The second destinatoin is the Dominican Republic! I visited DR about 3 years and that experience was 
                the first time I've ever gotten on a plane. It was a very special vacation for me because it was also 
                the first time that I was visiting the country that I'm from. While I was there I spent some time at a 
                resort and afterwards I went to visit the area my family grew up. The resort was such a nice experience, 
                it was all inclusive, the pools and beaches were very close and amazing. They had a spa there and so many 
                amazing places to eat. But then, that's when I visited Puerto Plata. I spent a lot of time learning my 
                family history as well as learning the history of the Dominican Republic itself. I visited the fort they 
                have that was used to protect the island. Overall, the Dominican Republlic is known for its beautiful beaches, 
                lively music, and rich hertitage. It is the most amazing place to be as they offer both relaxation and adventure.

            <p>
                The next destination is New York City! Since I am originally from NYC, I always try my best to find 
                fun things to do and new places to explore. One of my favorite parts about the city is how there's always 
                something happening, no matter the season. During the winter, I love going ice skating with friends and 
                enjoying the lights and decorations around the city. I recently went to see the Broadway show "Hell's Kitchen", 
                and it was such an amazing experience. The energy and talent on stage were incredible. And of course, 
                no summer is complete without a trip to Yankee Stadium to catch a game and cheer for the team. Overall, New 
                York City is known for its endless entertaiment, vibrant culture, and fast-paced energy. It is truly 
                the city that never sleeps.
